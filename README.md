6-Month DevOps Learning Plan
---
A structured 6-month, hands-on roadmap focused on building job-ready DevOps and platform engineering skills.

This repository documents practical labs, automation scripts, containerized applications, CI/CD pipelines, cloud deployments, and Kubernetes projects — built from scratch and incrementally improved.

## What This Demonstrates

- Strong Linux fundamentals (users, permissions, services, logs)
    
- Automation using Bash and Python
    
- Docker and multi-container applications
    
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
